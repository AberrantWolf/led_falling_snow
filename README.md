# LED Snowflake Lights

This is a simple Arduino project I used to set up 10 strands of 60 2812B RGB LED lights and make it look (loosely) like little snowflakes of light are falling gently along them.

You can do whatever you want with this. It's not bad code, but it's also not very complicated.

I did it with `Arduino IDE 2.0.3`, it relies on the `FastLED` library, and my board was an `ESP32 WROOMD devkit_v4`.
